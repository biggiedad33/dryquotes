Pair-of-quotes from Ibsen and other greats authors in norwegian and english. This repository is used by the promiscuous automation framework DryDeploy (https://github.com/bjoernf73/DryDeploy). My son, the maintainer of DryDeploy, forces his poor dad to maintain this repository without any pay whatsoever.
