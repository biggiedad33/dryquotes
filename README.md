# dryquotes
Pair-of-quotes from Ibsen and other greats authors in norwegian and english. This repository is used by the promiscuous automation framework DryDeploy (https://github.com/bjoernf73/DryDeploy). My son, bjoernf73, the creator of DryDeploy, forces his poor old dad to maintain this repository without any pay whatsoever. Unless I produce 3 quotes a day, he will refuse to drive me down to Vinmonopolet to by BiB.
